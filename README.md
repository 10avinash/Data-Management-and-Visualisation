## Questions for MySQL assignment
Query 1:

Horst Kloss is the contact for which customer company?

 

Query 2:

Write a query that gives the following columns:
1) The Order ID  
2) The Order Date  
3) The Ship Date  
4) The Number of Days between the Order Date and the Ship Date  
5) Which order/s have taken us the longest to fulfill?  

 

Query 3:

Write a query that gives the total number of products ordered by category. We've sold the most products from which category?

 

Query 4:

Write a query that returns all employees who have fulfilled a greater than average number of orders.  
The result set should have the following for each above average employee:

1) Employee ID  
2) First Name  
3) Last Name  
4) Total Orders  
This is a dynamic query which will require the use of sub-queries as the average is not a fixed data point 
and is expected to change over time.
